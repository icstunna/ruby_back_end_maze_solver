# laser_maze_coding_challenge
Algorithmic coding challenge as part of the interview process

***STARTING THE PROGRAM***

To initiate the Laser Maze game you must first run the command:
"ruby RUN_THIS_FILE.rb", in the laser_maze_coding_challenge directory.

The program will then prompt the user to make an input.

To begin the program the user must input "maze" followed by the path to the desired input file as well as the path for the desired output file.

IE: "maze ./path/to/input/file.csv ./path/to/output/file.csv"

if you do not have a input and or output file, you may use the path for the default input and or output file:

Input: "./db/input.csv"
Output: "./db/output.csv"

This will initiate the program and run the laser until a wall is hit or the laser is caught in a loop. The result will appear in the output file that you specified upon.

***RUNNING TESTS***

If you wish to examine or run the RSPEC tests for this program then you may do so by directing yourself to the spec directory and running the "rspec" command upon any file you desire.

I hope you enjoy examining my program as much as I enjoyed building it. Good luck upon your decision process and I eagerly await your feedback.
